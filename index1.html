<h3>Application Overview</h3>
    <p id="left">
        This application is going to allow the user to play hangman.
        It will give the user 10 wrong letters before failing them.
        It will tell the user when they guess a correct letter.
        It will draw a stickfigure as they guess letters incorrectly.
        When they guess the word correctly or run out of guesses,
        it will tell them and move onto the next round if they want
        to continue playing.
    </p>

<h4> Tech Overview</h4>
    <p>
        I will be using python to create this application. I do not
        plan on hosting it. It will use a word list dictionary as
        well as the random library.
